## COVID-19 Data Visualization App with Python
Simple web application for data visualization using Python.

## Motivation
A lot of Data Science tutorials end inside a Jupyter Notebook, not many of them show the deploy stage.

Since web developing isn't a core skill in most Data Analysis roles, it leaves professionals and enthusiats on the hands of 3rd parties softwares to scale their projects.

Although there are some great tutorials in english, I felt the need to contribute by writing an article in Brazilian Portuguese.
